                Shantell is an artist who is best known for her black and white compositions that result in an autobiographical and dreamlike meditation of lines; a language of characters, creatures and messages. Her work bridges the fine art and commercial world, and is instantly recognizable. And democratic. Like her mural for the Saraghina pizza place in the Bed Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is our personal. <br>

            <p class="about">
                We usually work for clients, we sometimes do self-initiated projects, but this was the first project we did for a friend. The obvious pitfalls of working for friends is that there is a real possibility of it getting a little messy, ambiguous, or unprofessional. Not to mention that some friends might expect you to work for them as a favor. Luckily none of this was the case with Shantell, who treated this project as seriously as any other regular client of ours would.

            <p>
                We always try to do something that people have not yet seen on the web, and try to give ourselves the freedom to come up with a strong home page by not thinking of it as a home page. Kind of like how you can probably come up with a better design for a toothbrush if the brief is not “redesign the toothbrush”, but “design a new way to clean your mouth”.
